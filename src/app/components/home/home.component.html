       <h3>About</h3>
       <p>Pokémon Centers come in a variety of shapes and sizes, ranging from very tall buildings to tiny little huts. Occasionally, they can be found out in the middle of nowhere. Every center has a Nurse Joy and a Chansey (in Unova, it is an Audino; In Kalos, it is a Wigglytuff; In Alola, it is a Blissey and a Comfey) to assist her. Pokémon Centers in the anime usually consist of a lobby, a recovery room for Pokémon in-healing to stay, an Emergency Room, a Poké Ball room, beds for weary trainers, and sometimes a cafeteria. They also have video phones and PCs, which trainers are welcome to use. All Pokémon Centers are connected in case of emergency.
